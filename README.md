# Udemy-course-analysis
A leading online learning platform Udemy has more than 100,000 courses and keeps
adding more courses every month. The objective of this report is to help Udemy in
predicting the relevancy score and course labels to improve their search result for
students based on the course content details, instructor details and the length of the
course. This model will facilitate course designers to identify the areas of improvement
to improve the visibility and popularity of the existing course content.  
  
To build the proof of concept, the “Data & Analytics” category was considered. A total
of 1,019 courses were available in the given domain. Majority of the ratings for the
course work was between 3.5 and 4.5 and the price range for the courses was in between
$25 to $150.  
  
These insights were taken into consideration while building an ensemble of machine
learning models to predict the relevancy score and the course label. The model predicts
the relevancy score and the course label with an accuracy of 91%. Language has a very
significant impact on the relevancy score. Also, course features like whether it is
downloadable, and price have higher impact on the relevancy score. Courses with
higher relevancy score directly impact the course label. Hence, Udemy should use this
model to improve the search relevance of courses and to understand what needs to be
done to improve the course popularity.
